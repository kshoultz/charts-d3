        <h2>Basics</h2>
        <p>The point of this page is to discover the differences between 'var', 'const', and 'let'. View the console and the source code to play with the different declarations. I've abandoned researching this because IE 10 and before do not support it.</p>
        
        <h3>var</h3>
        <p>I've been using this for a long time. And I don't see this changing as long as I have to support browsers that don't support 'let' or 'const'.</p>
        <p>'var' scopes to the context for which it was declared. JavaScript looks for the var in the current function. If it doesn't find it, it goes up a level until it does. If it doesn't find it, it throws an error. There is hoisting. If you declare a function (function myFunc(){}) it will be moved to the top of the scope. So keep that in mind. </p>
        <p>So you can have a global var, and then redefine it in a smaller context. It will use the redefinition, while not overwriting the outer definition.</p>
        <h3>const</h3>
        <p>"const" is not supported for IE before 11.</p>
        <p>This declaration creates a constant whose scope can be either global or local to the block in which it is declared. Global constants do not become properties of the window object, unlike var variables. An initializer for a constant is required; that is, you must specify its value in the same statement in which it's declared (which makes sense, given that it can't be changed later).</p>
        <p>The const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. It does not mean the value it holds is immutable, just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned. For instance, in the case where the content is an object, this means the object's contents (e.g., its parameters) can be altered.</p>
        <p>All the considerations about the "temporal dead zone" apply to both let and const.</p>
        <p>A constant cannot share its name with a function or a variable in the same scope.</p>
        
        <h3>let</h3>
        <p>"const" is not supported for IE before 11.</p>
        <p>"let" allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. This is unlike the var keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.</p>
        <p>All the considerations about the "temporal dead zone" apply to both let and const.</p>
